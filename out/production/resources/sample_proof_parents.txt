Theorem: For integers ((b,u)) such that ((b * u)),
the amount of ways to place "b" labelled balls into "u" labelled urns
such that each urn contains at most one ball is "factorial u" divided by ((factorial (u - b))).

Proof: We can choose ((b)) urns which will contain a ball in ((b * u)) ways,
and the balls can be matched up with the urns in ((b)) factorial ways,
making the total amount
(((u >> b) * factorial b
= (factorial u / (factorial b * factorial (u - b))) * factorial b
= factorial u / factorial (u - b))).
