We will show that both sides of the equation count the number of ways to choose a subset of size $k$ from a set of size $n$.
The left hand side of the equation counts this by definition.
Now we consider the right hand side.
To choose a subset of size $k$, we can instead choose the $n - k$ elements to exclude from the subset.
There are $n >> (n - k)$ 􏰁ways to do this.
Therefore the right hand side also counts the desired quantity.
