QUESTION: We will show that both sides of the equation count the number of ways to choose a subset of size $k$ from a set $S$ of size $n$.
LEFT: The left hand side of the equation counts this by definition.
RIGHT: Let $s$ be a fixed element.
We will show that the right hand side counts the desired quantity by conditioning on whether $s$ is in the subset.

First, we will count how many subsets of size $k$ include $s$.
Since such a subset includes $s$, there are $k - 1$ other elements in the subset, which must be chosen from the remaining $n - 1$ elements of $S$.
Therefore there are 􏰀$(n - 1) >> (k - 1)$ such subsets.

Second, we will count how many subsets of size $k$ do not include $s$.
Since the subset does not include $s$, all of its $k$ elements are chosen from the remaining $n - 1$ elements of $S$.
Therefore there are $(n - 1) >> k$ such subsets.

Since any subset of size $k$ either includes $s$ or does not (but not both), the total number of subsets is the sum of the counts in the two cases.
