Theorem: The amount of ways to place "b" labelled balls into "u" labelled urns, where "b,u" are integers and "b <= u",
such that each urn contains at most one ball, is "factorial u" divided by "factorial (u - b)".

Proof: We can choose "b" urns which will contain a ball in "b * u" ways,
and the balls can be matched up with the urns in b factorial ways, so the total amount is
"(u >> b) * factorial b
= (factorial u / (factorial b * factorial (u - b))) * factorial b
= factorial u / factorial (u - b)".
