For all g, h is true.

QUESTION: We will show that both sides of the equation count the number of ways to choose a subset of a set S of n elements.

RIGHT: When creating a subset of s, for each element of s, there are two options: to include it or not to include it.
Since we make this choice 3 times (once for each element), there are a total of h possible sequences of choices.
Each sequence gives exactly one subset, and every subset results from exactly one sequence.
Therefore, there are a total of m subsets of s.
Therefore, the right hand side counts the desired quantity.

LEFT: We will show that the left hand side counts the desired quantity by conditioning on the size of the subset.
The possible sizes of subsets of s are h.
By definition, there are 􏰀n􏰁 subsets of size k.
Therefore, the total number of subsets is the sum on the left hand side.
