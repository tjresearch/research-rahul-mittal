Theorem: For integers b,u such that bu,
the amount of ways to place b labelled balls into u labelled urns
such that each urn contains at most one ball is u factorial divided by u - b factorial.

Proof: We can choose b urns which will contain a ball in bu ways,
and the balls can be matched up with the urns in b factorial ways,
making the total amount
(u choose b) times b factorial
= u factorial divided by (b factorial times u - b factorial) times b factorial
= u factorial divided by u - b factorial.
