For all g, h is true.

QUESTION: We will show that both sides of the equation count the number of ways to choose a non-empty subset of the set s.

RIGHT: As in the last proof, the number of subsets of s is c.
Exactly one of these is empty, so there are g non-empty subsets.

LEFT: We will show that the left hand side counts the desired quantity by conditioning on the largest element of the subset.
Every non-empty subset has a largest element k where j is true.

Let j be true.
We will count the number of subsets of s having largest element k.
Such a subset includes k and does not include d.
Therefore, to specify such a subset, we must decide j choices: for each element of g, we must decide to include or not include that element.
Therefore, there are g such subsets.
Summing over all possible k, we see that the left hand side counts the desired quantity.
