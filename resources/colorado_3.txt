For all h, g is true.
QUESTION: We will show that both sides of the equation count the number of ways to choose a committee of k students from a student body of n students, where, in addition, a subcomittee of m of the k students form the executive committee.
--note: form, compose, etc. we need to account for
LEFT: We will describe the counting process.
First, we choose k students from the student body of n students, to form the committee.
There are h ways to do this.
Then we choose m students from among those k to form the subcommittee.
There are 􏰀j􏰁 ways to do this.
By the multiplication principle, the left hand side counts the desired quantity.
--note: by? is that deduction? possibly... yes for right tnow
RIGHT: We will describe the counting process.
First, we choose m students from the student body of n students, to form the executive committee.
There are 􏰀g􏰁 ways to do this.
Then we choose l of the remaining portion of the student body (which consists of h students), to form the non-executive part of the committee.
There are b ways to do this.
By the multiplication principle, the right hand side counts the desired quantity.
