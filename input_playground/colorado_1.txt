We will show that both sides of the equation count the number of ways to choose a subset of size $k$ from a set of size $n$.
The left hand side of the equation counts this by definition.
Now we consider the right hand side.
To choose a subset of size $k$, we can instead choose the $n - k$ elements to exclude from the subset.
There are $n >> (n - k)$ 􏰁ways to do this.
Therefore the right hand side also counts the desired quantity.

"To choose a subset of size $k$, we can instead choose the $n - k$ elements to exclude from the subset."

choosing a subset of size $k$ is the same as choosing subset of $n - k$ that wasn't in the subset of size $k$

there's a bijection between subsets of size $k$ and subsets of size $n - k$ which is the bijection between a subset and the subset containing the elements not in the subset, i.e. the complement.
