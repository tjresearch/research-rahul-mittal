QUESTION: We will show that both sides of the equation count the number of ways to choose a subset of a set $S$ of $n$ elements.

RIGHT: When creating a subset of $S$, for each element of $S$, there are $2$ options:
to include it or not to include it.
Since we make this choice $n$ times (once for each element),
there are a total of $2 ^ n$ possible sequences of choices.
Each sequence gives exactly one subset,
and every subset results from exactly one sequence.
Therefore there are a total of $2^n$ subsets of $S$.
Therefore the right hand side counts the desired quantity.

LEFT: We will show that the left hand side counts the desired quantity
by conditioning on the size of the subset.
The possible sizes of subsets of $S$ are 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
By definition, there are 􏰀$n >> k$􏰁 subsets of size $k$.
Therefore the total number of subsets is the sum on the left hand side.

9 sts

(4,5) => 6
(6,7,8) => 9
9 => 10

(14,15) => 16
