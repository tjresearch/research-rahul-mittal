QUESTION: We will show that both sides of the equation count the number of ways to choose a non-empty subset of the set S = {1, 2, . . . , n}.

RIGHT: As in the last proof, the number of subsets of $S$ is $2 ^ n$.
Exactly one of these is empty,
so there are $(2 ^ n) − 1$ non-empty subsets.

LEFT: We will show that the left hand side counts the desired quantity by conditioning on the largest element of the subset.
Every non-empty subset has a largest element $k$ where 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
Let 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
We will count the number of subsets of $S$ having largest element $k$.
Such a subset includes k and does not include $k + 1, . . . , n$.
Therefore to specify such a subset we must decide k − 1 choices:
for each element of ${1, 2, . . . , k − 1}$, we must decide to include or not include that element.
Therefore there are $2 ^ (k - 1)$ such subsets.
Summing over all possible k, we see that the left hand side counts the desired quantity.
