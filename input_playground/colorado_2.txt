QUESTION: We will show that both sides of the equation count the number of ways to choose a subset of size $k$ from a set $S$ of size $n$.
LEFT: The left hand side of the equation counts this by definition.
RIGHT: Let $s$ be a fixed element.
We will show that the right hand side counts the desired quantity by conditioning on whether $s$ is in the subset.

First, we will count how many subsets of size $k$ include $s$.
Since such a subset includes $s$, there are $k - 1$ other elements in the subset, which must be chosen from the remaining $n - 1$ elements of $S$.
Therefore there are 􏰀$(n - 1) >> (k - 1)$ such subsets.

Second, we will count how many subsets of size $k$ do not include $s$.
Since the subset does not include $s$, all of its $k$ elements are chosen from the remaining $n - 1$ elements of $S$.
Therefore there are $(n - 1) >> k$ such subsets.

Since any subset of size $k$ either includes $s$ or does not (but not both), the total number of subsets is the sum of the counts in the two cases.

"Since such a subset includes $s$, there are $k - 1$ other elements in the subset"
the size of a subset of size $k$ that includes $s$, but without $s$, is $k - 1$.

"which must be chosen from the remaining $n - 1$ elements of $S$"
a subset of size $k$ that includes $s$, but without $s$, is equivalent to a subset of size $k$ of a set of size $n - 1$ = T \ {s}.


the other one:
a subset of size $k$ that does not include $s$, is equivalent to a subset of size $k$ of a set of size $n - 1$ = T \ {s}.

Since any subset of size $k$ either includes $s$ or does not (but not both), the total number of subsets is the sum of the counts in the two cases.

3.2.5 Cardinalities of Subsets
We wish to write down rules about cardinalities of subsets of types, using Ensemble and sig. Given a list of elements that makes up a subset, if the list has no duplicates then the cardinality of this subset is equal to the length of the list.
Theorem cardinal of list A (l : list A) : NoDup l → |sig (list to subset l)| = length l. Corollary subset length match T (l l’ : list T ) :
l ∼=l’ →NoDupl →NoDupl’ →lengthl =lengthl’.
The notation (l ∼= l’) here expands to (list to subset l) = (list to subset l’). Next we
have several basic lemmas about empty, nonempty, and singleton sets.
